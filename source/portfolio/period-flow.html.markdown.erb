Besides doing all sorts of design work I tend to expand my skills in every direction, that's why I'm learning to program as well. I just adore new Apple's language Swift and I've made menstrual diary app called Period Flow. You can check it on App Store. Swift 3 version with many enhancements should come soon. I'm working on it.
